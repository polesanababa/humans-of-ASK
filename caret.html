        <p class="p3">As I mentioned earlier, health is something that I care about.  When I was in 6th grade, I started to care about being healthy. I realized that everyone weighed less  </p>

        <p class="p3">than I did and I was ashamed by that. So I started to do exercises and I became good at them. Along with that, I became more thinner and I was happy with the </p>

        <p class="p3">results. That was until summer when everyone is enjoying rest, electronics, pools, and more. In my case, this made me to gain weight. That was until August and the</p>
      
        <p class="p3">Paris Olympics. There is this one Olympian that I look up to and his name is Noah Lyles. He is a track runner, won an event, got a gold medal, and in the first place, qualified for   </p>
  
        <p class="p3">the Olympics. I became interested in Track and Field and I decided that somehow, I would work to make it to the Olympics. Now even though this is a crazy dream, I </p>
 
        <p class="p3">have been putting work in. Also, I know that there is a chance that I won't go to the Olympics, so I have a backup plan (software engineering) I have gained less weight, </p>
    
        <p class="p3">been eating healthier foods, and especially, running way more. When I compared my old self and my new self it was extremely different. I went from chubby and</p>
       
        <p class="p3">somewhat fast, to ab-popping, vein-popping, leg strong, and extremely fast. So my idea started working out. My only problem is that I had to balance it </p>
      
        <p class="p3"> out along with school, tutoring, family, and Christianity. Even now I am struggling with that problem especially with finals around the corner. On the other hand, because of</p>
     
        <p class="p3">me learning how to balance everything out , I have started to have a vision on where to join a track team next season and how to keep training. So </p>
        
        <p class="p3">because of me wanting to become an Olympian, I have been working hard and have been healthier. Also, even my school life hasn't taken too big of a hit. This was my final care.</p>
