        <p class="p2">Something that I care about is grades and my physical health. My care </p>
        <p class="p2">for grades came from my father. Now in my opinion, he is a genius. He </p>
        <p class="p2">never got failing grades on anything, he skipped masters to a PhD, and</p>
        <p class="p2">he knows how to deal with my brother. So, when grades actually started</p>
        <p class="p2">getting included into my life, I tried to follow in my father's steps. See,</p>
        <p class="p2">the only thing is that school doesn't make it easy to get all As and A+'s. </p>
        <p class="p2">You actually had to work for it. When I got my first NC on a test, I went </p>
        <p class="p2">into the school bathroom and cried my heart out. I had never got </p>
        <p class="p2">anything below a C and on that day, it happened. In my opinion, I failed </p>
        <p class="p2">and got a 0, even though it was a 65 and she made everyone to redo the test.  </p>
        <p class="p2">I was a failure that couldn't even follow my father's steps when he didn't</p>
        <p class="p2"> even have as close to as much resources as me.</p>
        <p class="p2">I genuinely wanted to punch myself in the face and leave this realm.</p>
        <p class="p2">From that day on, I made it my school mission to do as well as possible in school </p>
        <p class="p2"> and not get any NCs , even thought I have messed up twice in the same class</p>
        <p class="p2">I am not a science whiz, and I am trying my best to be better and not so bad at things.</p>
        <p class="p2"> So, I inherited my care and passion for grades from my father.</p>
